Hello!

The aim of this project is to take the original actionscript/flash 
program found in the originSource folder and recreate the same program 
in C++ with the ability to export agian in various formats. Also, we wish 
to give the program the ability to add images into it, and it should be 
cross platform.

The current plan is to use the GTK+ 3.0 library to make the innitial GUI 
and animation.
