Hello! Welcome to the Walfas Project.

The aim of this project is to take the original actionscript/flash 
program found in the originSource folder and recreate the same program 
in C++ with the ability to import and export in various formats, a more robust
toolset, easy importing of images by rereading all image files in 
the image directory, and have an easy, saveable tagging system.
Also the program should be cross platform between Linux and windows.

Current Plan(Programmers):
1) use GTK+ library for initial GUI and image manipulation
2) find and research a good swf library
3) or, make our own api using the swfDocumentation.pdf from adobe

(Artists and Users):
1) request features that should be added to the program
2) add/extend the default image library
3) run and issue bug reports to Programmers

(other contributors):
1) run and issue bug reports to Programmers
2) check spelling and descriptions in the source files
3) participate in making the program better
